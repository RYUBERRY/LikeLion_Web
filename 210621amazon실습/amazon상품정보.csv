Very cute colors!
Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  My skin tone is neutral to warm; these colors are very beautiful and complement my skin, and blend great. It is a tiny palette, so I recommend it as a starting nude palette to see if you really like these colors.Some colors have a slight shimmer to them, others are more matte. Enjoy!

Maybelline never disappoints !!!
Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021Color: 120 THE 24K NUDESVerified Purchase

  I have used Maybelline ever since I started using makeup !!! this is amazing... Im Indian and have wheatish brown skin  with really dark eyelids, so my problem is mostly trying to get the colour to show and last... This works ... even the lighter colours show up without a primer ... Maybelline products have always lasted a long while for me... its just been a week or so for me, but I will let you know if i have any problems in the future :)

Huge mess upon delivery
Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  Item appeared well packaged but once completely opened it was clear the item was ruined.  Over half the shadows were completely crumbled which caused the remainder shadows, as well as the inside and outside of the case to get coated in loose shadow dust.  A huge mess.

Must Have Palette
Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2017Color: 120 THE 24K NUDESVerified Purchase

  I saw several YouTubers who bought this palette, review it, all positive reviews, so I got it.  The pigments are awesome.  I love the colors and they're all very easy to blend.  I don't have problems with the eyeshadow creasing, flaking or not holding its color during the day.  It didn't cause any eye or skin irritation either nor did it bother my contact lenses.  Endless color combinations to wear in all seasons and all times of day.

  While the colors look amazing in packaging. When trying to make it show up on my skin it took a while. And even then it didn’t stay long. The colors are not supposed to be blend in with my skin colors just supposed to be lighter/hence the nude.

Versatile and GREAT palette for travelling!!!
Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2015Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  I personally LOVE this palette!!! I have been using it for a little over a week and have been able to create various day and night time looks from it! One of my favorite things about it is that the color seems to stay fairly pigmented throughout the day without all blending together to become too dark or creasing and wearing off to become too light! I can create looks that are soft and natural but then can easily/quickly transition to dramatic looks with smokey eyes all with this palette!!! If you are travelling and want a versatile palette that is going to allow you to create looks which are similar to those from the Naked and Full Exposure palettes and you don't want to bring your expensive make up with you I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this palette!!! The applicator in the palette is nothing special so I definitely recommend having your own brushes BUT if you are in a pinch and need to use the one that comes with the palette, it gets the job done.

Good value for the price, great colors
Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2015Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  Very good product for the price.Gorgeous colors and reasonably pigmented.  I get better application using my own brushes than the wand that comes with the palette.  My only complaint and the only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it doesn't last all day.  Even using Urban Decay's primer it is very much faded at the end of my long (10-11 hrs) work day.  I like it enough that I bought a second immediately after buying the first in case they discontinued it.I also use Urban Decay's Naked2 and Naked3 and, in comparison, they are more pigmented and last longer than the Maybelline palette.My favorite look uses the four on the right - they make an absolutely perfect look to wear with cool blues, greys, and blacks.

Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  The product came as expected and I like the color palate since it blends in well with my skin color. But I had to fix two colors myself in order to use it. Whoever had a hold of this wasn't very careful and it makes me think this wasn't secured during transport. I only got this to get the free delivery along with another product I bought but come on...at least try to handle things with care.

  Crappy product, you literally get what you pay for. The colors are impossible to get to stay on your eyes and the palette just falls apart. Very crummy and cheap. It's unfortunate since the colors were exactly what I wanted but I'd rather spend more money and get a better longer lasting product

This is a good palette for a great price
Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2017Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  This is a good palette for a great price. I’m not super into eyeshadow and for my look, it’s definitely not worth it to buy expensive palettes at Sephora and Ulta. This palette is great; it’s got a great range of colors that are very versatile. I don’t invest in eyeshadow primer either, however I use liquid concealer as a primer and it works just as well. The colors are definitely more pigmented with primer so I’d suggest buying one or using liquid concealer/foundation (I don’t think they would show up as well or stay on for that long without it). I saw many people had packaging/damage issues but my product came wrapped in a ton of bubble wrap and was fine, so I assume amazon has now fixed that issue.

Great product for anyone that doesn’t care about name brands
Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2018Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  I bought it since I wanted a compact eyeshadow pallet for traveling and did not want to spend a lot of money on a new one. I’m not a make up expert and I don’t care about the brand as long as the product works.The shades in this pallet are great, however the pigmentation is not very strong. Make sure to prime your eyelids with a nice primer and it will last all day without creasing.  All in all is not a bad pallet if you’re looking for a soft look and wear it with a decent primer.

  The is a great palette. The colors are not as pigmented as the Urban Decay Naked palette, but this is a good, cheap alternative. I love the gold and brown tones. I prefer to use the shimmery shadows because I think they show up better on my skin. They seem to be easier to build on compared to the more matte shades. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save money or is just learning how to do makeup. With the right primer, the color will last all day.

  Strange to pick out a makeup on the internet, but this time it worked out! Beautiful colors, my favorite being the beautiful pink color (second row, 5th one). It has some glitter in it, making it rich and somewhat sparkly.My only complaint is the open storage compartment for the 2 applicators. It kept knocking out the second one onto the floor so often that I just put it away. That being my only complaint, it's all good after that!Does wear kind of quickly compared to some of my other brands, but not a big deal for me.

Staple makeup item
Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2015Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  Great little palette! Maybelline's The Nudes really is a staple in any makeup collection, with it's wide array of shades and limitless combinations. The colors are nicely pigmented and apply smoothly, my personal favorite is the gold one in the second row. The guide in the back is especially helpful, as it gives ideas for looks to wear. These shadows last all day atop ELF's eyelid primer, and I've been complimented on them numerous times since I've worn them out. With its variety and combinations, this is a must have and inexpensive neutral palette suitable for anyone!

  best to use a eye primer.  I use Urban Decay original formula eye primer.  When used with this, the colors will last all day.  A lot of the colors are shimmery, only one or two could be called matte or satin.  I didn't realize that when I bought it, or I probably wouldn't have.  I use it but probably won't repurchase.  I do like that maybelline is trying to market a palette.  I get frustrated with the quads.  You usually have a least one color you don't use thus making your purchase more costly.  With a palette you do have more options.

Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2015Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  This palette is great if you want a Naked palette but don't want to (or can't afford to) spend the money. It is more towards the low end scale for makeup so you can't expect it to be perfect, but the colors are pigmented and go on great, blend easily. You may have to build it up a bit to get the color as shown in the palette but I don't mind it. Helps to use a primer before hand, if you can use a white one even better. Has a nice range of colors, though, and I like how it's set up to be used as duo, trio, and quads. Very good for beginners! Love this palette for everyday looks

  I absolutely love this product and was so surprised that it came so quickly with such a fair price. The colors are so nice and shiny in a play and very smooth I recommend using a primer.

Fantastic pallet!
Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2015Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  I'm thoroughly impressed with this pallet! All and I mean all the colors are beautiful! I'd say their medium to high pigmentation depending on shade and some of the liter shades are more sheer, but provide a soft wash of shimmering color. Only one shade is Matte. Colors are pinks, maybes, rose gold/coppery to deeper plums and a light and medium gray. The price can't be beat. I typically use high end cosmetics, UD, BAREMINERALS, TOO FACED. This pallet competes VERY WELL. I think I'll order a backup.

  Colors are very pigmented and easy to blend. My favorite neutral color palette. Timeless. Been using it for years and hope it never gets discontinued.

  I purchased the Maybelline New York ""Blushed Nudes"" eyeshadow collection. The colors are very pretty as shown and it is fun mixing them to make another color. They do go on smoothly and last all day. I would buy this product again.

Too loose and pale
Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2018Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  These are great colors and a good combination of frosty and matte, but the product is too powdery and loose when trying to put it on. Not the usual consistency when applying other dry eye shadows I own. It wasn't enough to impress and I can't recommend them. Sad that this is Maybelline.

  Wow! I didn't realize there were so many items in this set.  They are of good quality.  I just wish the number and use for each was printed on the individual brushes.

one of the compacts was busted
Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2018Color: 06 THE BLUSHED NUDESVerified Purchase

  I was kind of disappointed about it arriving with one of the compacts broken, but it's not a big deal, I just broke up the pieces and shoved it together, wet it, and smoothed it out. Once it dried, it was good as new. I know this might have been the fault of shipping, so I can't complain. They didn't exactly know that it was makeup. Anyway, the pallette is beautiful and the colors are extremely pigmented. Aside from the broken compact, which was a little messy inside the container, I have no complaints.

Cheaper than Walmart's price, so just get from Amazon.
Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2015Color: 02 THE NUDESVerified Purchase

  Hmm... I could pay a high price at Walmart for this, orrrr I could just order it for a lot cheaper on here, and have it delivered.  I was smart and chose the latter.  We all know this is an awesome alternative to the NAKED palette.  The colors are rich, blendable, and stay put through the day There's a lot of options for a neutral look or smokey eyes.  Lots of different color combos to try.  BUT MOSTLY buy it on Amazon, because it's cheaper.
